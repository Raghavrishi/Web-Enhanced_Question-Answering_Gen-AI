## Contextual Q&A with Generative AI
### Technologies used:
- Pretrained model: DistilBERT
- Beautiful Soup (bs4), PyTorch, TensorFlow
  
By giving out a context and asking some questions to the model it gives you the answers and even if we ask the model to give you back the context as a simple sentence it gives us. And which works as a chatbot.
And web scrabing concept is also used here, by giving a websiteâ€™s url and asking up questions, the model scrabes
out the text from the webpage and answers for the questions you ask.

### Detailed Breakdown:
Providing Context and Answering Questions:
    When you provide a context or background information, the model uses that information to understand and answer your questions accurately. This context can be anything from a specific problem you're facing to general information about your interests or work.
For example, if you tell the model that you're working on a frontend development project, it will use that context to give relevant advice or information when you ask questions related to frontend development.

### Retrieving Context:
    The model can remember the context you've provided and retrieve it when needed. If you ask the model to give back the context, it can summarize or list out the key points you've shared.

### Web Scraping:
    When you provide a URL and ask questions about the content on that webpage, the model can use web scraping techniques to extract text from the webpage and use that information to answer your questions.
This involves fetching the webpage, parsing the HTML to extract relevant text, and then processing that text to find the answers you're looking for.
Together, these capabilities make the model a powerful tool for answering questions and providing assistance based on both stored context and real-time information from the web.
